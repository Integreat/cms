# REST

The REST documentation consists of two components.

## schemata

[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

The following REST route definitions exist:

* schemata/pages.json
* schemata/event_pages.json
* schemata/languages.json
* schemata/locations.json

## generator

The generator allows you to generate a nice html representation of your JSON Schema files.
This implementation is likely to changes as it's not perfectly stable!
