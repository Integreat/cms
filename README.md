# Integreat
This is the legacy back end for Integreat. Issues are tracked in https://issues.integreat-app.de/projects/WP/.

## WordPress CMS
We use WordPress to manage and deliver our content.
This is mostly due to the huge community behind it which provides an overwhelming number of already-tested plugins. This saves us a lot of time since one week of coding becomes two clicks of installing and activating the plugin.


## Collaboration
Feel free to check out the [issues](https://github.com/Integreat/cms/issues), fork this repository and send in some pull requests.
You might want to get started by [setting up your local development environment](https://github.com/Integreat/cms/wiki/Wordpress-local).
